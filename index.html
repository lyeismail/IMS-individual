		  and my school is arguably a rural school. I am an ordinary person living in the village of my father's side. Alhamdullilah, even I didnt make it 5A in UPSR, 
		  but still i managed got result in flying colors which is, I didnt want to leave 'B' alone hehehe i got 4A 1B.</p>

          <p>New phase for me to step in secondary school. It is not easy because I had to stay in hostel. My secondary school was 
		  SEKOLAH MENENGAH KEBANGSAAN AGAMA KEDAH :D. I survived and created a lot of memories with my friends in secondary school life, after PMR, I still in the same school until I take my SPM.
		  Its kinda sad after SPM farewell party, whereby everyone will make their own path and choose the best career for a brighter future but now, 
		  we still got contact and keep in touch to each other.</p>

		  So, time to fill out the form to enter the diploma, i think, in general, everything I choose relate to account which my core in secondary school. therefore, my courses 
		  for diploma was DIPLOMA IN BANKING in UITM MERBOK, KEDAH. Alhamdullilah with my back bone, positive support from everyone that mean a lot in my life, I was survived and managed to finished the study and make it until graduation day.

          <p>It quite sad that i need to moved to KELANTAN because I continue study in marketing course in UITM KELANTAN Cawangan KOTA BHARU. Once again, degree life taught me 
		  another sacrificed lesson. IM HOME SICK, It so far away from my house, my friends, indeed i need to make new friends, because, mostly my friends in diploma, they 
		  continue study in Financial courses. However, I believe I can make it, so here I am, almost finish my degree life eventhough, only about 3 semester in Kelantan but, everyone got
		  no clue which world currently hit by pandemic COVID 19, so another 3 semester, we keep in touch on online class, it kinda sad because no college and study environment. but all this happened, it happens for a reason.
		  Personally, I pray for better future for everyone and hope this disease will end soon and we will live peacefully like before without physical distancing and wearing the mask.</p>
		<p> So that its, summary of my education life. InsyaAllah, for upcoming days, I pray for healthy body and bright future and I can repay 
		all the kindness of my precious family especially and my beloved friends</p>
